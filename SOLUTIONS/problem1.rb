# If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
# The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# Find all multiples of 3 <= 1000 and store in array: mult_3 

# Find all multiples of 5 <= 1000 and store in array: mult_5

# Find all multiples of 15 <= 1000 and store in array: mult_15

# Calculate the sum of mult_3 + mult_5

# Calculate the sum of mult_15

# Subtract
